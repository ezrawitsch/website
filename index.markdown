#### In papers, photos, videos, sketches, podcasts, and publications I explore the relationship between people and the places they build. I graduated with a degree in Geography and Urban Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2019. ####

I am currently serving as the lead cartographer for **Southland: A Los Angeles County Atlas and Alamanac**, edited by Dr. William Deverell and Dr. Wade Graham. We are a project of the [USC-Huntington Institute on California and the West](https://dornsife.usc.edu/icw/) and funded by a grant from the [Haynes Foundation](https://haynesfoundation.org). 

In the last few years, I've explored this theme from numerous perspectives:

- I researched and wrote an honors thesis concerning the nature of urban public space in a marketplace on the outskirts of Prague, Czechia. It was published in late 2020 in Lidé mesta / Urban People, Charles University’s journal of urban anthropology. [Read it here.](https://lidemesta.cuni.cz/LM-1154-version1-w_rawitsch.pdf)

- I worked for Alexandros Washburn, former Chief Urban Designer of New York, developing new projects in New York and North Carolina, helping to host his [public office hours](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170112/red-hook/urban-planning-zoning-red-hook-alex-washburn) in Brooklyn,  building models for a [new island in New York Harbor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBzFlvE5wew), and launching the [Model Block](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/model-block-red-hook/). 

- I spent a summer interning with Habitat for Humanity International in Bratislava, Slovakia, working with my colleagues to [understand public spaces from the perspective of users](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2U1cqkqWkhKWUtieWZOV2lwZHM/view?usp=sharing) in Central and Eastern Europe.

- I wrote & produced a variety of audio content, including [original audio essays](https://soundcloud.com/ezrawitsch/sets/audio-essays-1) and the 27 Views Podcast, an literary interview show dedicated to writers from the American South.

- I founded and edited [Volume Magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aiAPlBstxX5zbx_AZ72ALcPwXeIZ1RlM/view?usp=sharing), a publication dedicated to the perspective of young people living in Los Angeles - a city that is often caricatured and misunderstood. 

Other recent work includes my time as a member of the Editorial Board of the [Carolina Planning Journal](http://carolinaplanning.unc.edu/), and my investigation into the socioeconomic impact of physical infrastructure, focused on Durham, North Carolina and under the guidance of [Prof. Javier Arce-Nazario](https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/javier-arce-nazario/) working in R and Python to model how railroad tracks and other infrastructure correlate with socioeconomic inequality.
