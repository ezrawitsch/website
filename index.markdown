### In papers, photos, videos, sketches, podcasts, and publications I explore the relationship between people and the places they build. I graduated with a degree in Geography and Urban Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2019. ###

In the last few years, I've explored this theme from numerous perspectives:

- I spent a summer interning with Habitat for Humanity International in Bratislava, Slovakia, working with my colleagues to understand public spaces from the perspective of users in Central and Eastern Europe.

- I researched and wrote an honors thesis concerning the nature of urban public space in a marketplace on the outskirts of Prague, Czechia. It was published in late 2020 in Lidé mesta / Urban People, Charles University’s journal of urban anthropology. [link] Read it here.

- I worked for Alexandros Washburn, former Chief Urban Designer of New York, developing new projects in New York and North Carolina, helping to host his public office hours in Brooklyn,  building models for a new island in New York Harbor, and launching the Model Block. 

- I wrote & produced a variety of audio content, including original audio essays and the 27 Views Podcast, an literary interview show dedicated to writers from the American South.

- I founded and edited Volume Magazine, a publication dedicated to the perspective of young people living in a city that is often caricatured and misunderstood. 

Other recent work includes my time as a member of the Editorial Board of the Carolina Planning Journal, and my investigation into the socioeconomic impact of physical infrastructure, focused on Durham, North Carolina and under the guidance of Prof. Javier Arce-Nazario working in R and Python to model how railroad tracks and other infrastructure correlate with socioeconomic inequality.
